# Some packages, like GDAL, must be installed prior to running this script.
# On Ubuntu these packages are likely installed via '$ apt' or '$ apt-get',
# and on MacOS Homebrew is a common choice. Developers should read through
# this script, and the other scripts it invokes, and determine if it is
# appropriate to execute for their environment. At a high-level the steps
# should be matched, but the specific commands may need to be modified.
